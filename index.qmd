# About

This workshop focuses on using R/RStudio with Git/GitHub, `renv`, and `targets`. This will be pretty hands on, so it will be helpful to configure as much as possible in advance. I can help debug if we have any issues on the day.

## Setup

These are the following pieces to set up in advance:

1. [Register a GitHub account](https://github.com)
1. [Install/update R and RStudio](https://happygitwithr.com/install-r-rstudio)
1. [Install Git](https://happygitwithr.com/install-git#install-git)
1. [Install Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/)
